# Answer for QUIZ Questions
1. **Answer to Question 1**  _18 Students got it right_

Refer to : Slide RTOS-1 page no 12: What was the motivation to build an Operating system
```
There are many reasons why operating system evolved, the key  I am looking is the point I stressed in class, 
"module they developed are common across may applications  and they can be reused"  .. If I see the answer contains the gist of
the above line, I accepted it. If not I rejected it. This is one of the key technical reasons. I am looking for technical answers
than general answers. I give importance to those to listen in class and note down the key points.

```
Dead Line Oriented. That was the term I was expecting. If there is a word
dead line any where in your answer I gave full marks. The reason is,
I have connected it with the expiry date of the medicines. I had explained this
by taking the same example in class... Dead line means Expiry,  that is why I had 
underlined it in slides but did not explicity mention is slides.  Few students
wrote, Firm Real time and Dead line based/oriented etc. I accepted all that.
