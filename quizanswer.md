# Answer for QUIZ Questions
1. *Answer to Question 1*

Refer to : Slide RTOS-1 page no 12: What was the motivation to build an Operating system
```
There are many reasons why operating system evolved, the key  I am looking is the point I stressed in class, 
"module they developed are common across may applications  and they can be reused"  .. If I see the answer contains the gist of
the above line, I accepted it. If not I rejected it. This is one of the key technical reasons. I am looking for technical answers
than general answers. I give importance to those to listen in class and note down the key points.
