# Answer for QUIZ Questions
1. **Answer to Question 1**  _18 Students got it right_

Refer to : Slide RTOS-1 page no 12: What was the motivation to build an Operating system
```
There are many reasons why operating system evolved, the key  I am looking is the point I stressed in class, 
"module they developed are common across may applications  and they can be reused"  .. If I see the answer contains the gist of
the above line, I accepted it. If not I rejected it. This is one of the key technical reasons. I am looking for technical answers
than general answers. I give importance to those to listen in class and note down the key points.

4. **Answer to Question 4**  _Only 7 students got it right_ :expressionless:
Refer to Slide no 20. 

```
Dead Line Oriented. That was the term I was expecting. If there is a word
dead line any where in your answer I gave full marks. The reason is,
I have connected it with the expiry date of the medicines. I had explained this
by taking the same example in class... Dead line means Expiry,  in some case
the dead line carries the same importance that of expiry date.
That is why I had  underlined it in slides but did not explicity mention is slides.  
Few students wrote, "Firm Real time and Dead line based/oriented etc". I accepted all that.
But Firm Real Time is not acceptable to me..
